# Hypotenuse Calculator (C# Console Application)

A simple command-line application written in C# that calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean Theorem.

This project demonstrates basic C# concepts, including user input, data type conversion, mathematical operations, and console output.

## 📌 Overview
The Hypotenuse Calculator prompts the user to enter the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle (Side A and Side B). It then calculates and displays the length of the hypotenuse (Side C).

**Formula used:**
c = √(a² + b²)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Console Application
- System Namespace
- `Math.Sqrt()` method

## ▶️ How It Works
1. Program starts and displays a title message.  
2. User is prompted to enter the value for Side A.  
3. User is prompted to enter the value for Side B.  
4. Program calculates the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean Theorem.  
5. Result is displayed in the console.  
6. Application waits for a key press before closing.

## 📖 Mathematical Background
This application is based on the Pythagorean Theorem, which states:
In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

## 🔧 Possible Future Improvements
- Implement input validation to prevent non-numeric entries
- Format the output to a fixed number of decimal places
- Allow multiple calculations without restarting the program
- Add exception handling
- Expand the application into a graphical user interface (GUI)
